### Running App:
- The App code can run using and IDE that supports Android (Android Studio, VS-Code, Eclipse, ...etc).

### Running App Unit Tests and Generate Coverage Reports:
- The app unit tests as well can run using any IDE.
- The app unit tests can be run separately like regular Kotlin class, no need to run the app itself.
- Each unit test class can run separately, and every function of the class can run separately.
- The test code coverage report can be generated along with the unit test execution using any IDE (e.g in Android Studio you can select "Run [class-name] with Coverage" instead of "Run [class-name]"), and using the same IDE you can have all the coverage reports accomolated for the whole app.
  
### Installing App on Android Devices:
- The app can be installed in Android Devices using one of two ways:
    1. run the app directly from the IDE to the connected device after selecting the device as the target device (USB Debugging should be [enabled from device settings](https://www.embarcadero.com/starthere/xe5/mobdevsetup/android/en/enabling_usb_debugging_on_an_android_device.html))
    2. use the IDE to generate app APK and install that executable apk on the device after transferring it to the device
